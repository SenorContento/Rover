I am working on designing several modules for Rover! You can find the code for them [here][modules], in the modules folder, and also [here][modules-disabled], in the folder where modules are disabled for now. The reason I have two separate folders is because I have not yet added proper module enabling and disabling code for each module.

You can find the documentation to the modules below:

* [Telegram Bot][telegram-bot]
* [Minecraft Bot][minecraft-bot]
* [Discord Bot][discord-bot]
* [IRC Bot][irc-bot]
* [Bandwidth (Phone) Bot][bandwidth-bot]
* [Reddit Bot][reddit-bot]
* [Stream Bot][stream-bot]
