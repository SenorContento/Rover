# Get database working so I can not only record messages, but also to have user sessions (for both multistep commands and remembering user preferences)
# Put commands into their own separate classes
# Change uid to chatid (or cid)
# Add ImportError (if you can) to help gracefully crash and instruct the user what packages to install!!!
# I may see about dynamic dns with the cloudflare api
# I am also considering linking the robot to external programs so I can use my Google Voice number with PBX software (as for real, who as a developer wouldn't want to control their robot or computer over the phone)
# I may split the commands into modules once I get the qrcode thing working so I can just enable and disable modules at will (and it will make developing modules more intuitive)
# Also, I need to be able to inform users if they are missing certain packages and how to find out/install the packages
# Maybe I will implement Hotbits (and Random.org) support for truly random numbers produced by radioactivity (and mostly random by atmospheric noise from Random.org)
# Add dictionary support (such as /define bliss)
# Add support for Rebrandly API
# Make a /sudo command so I can have Rover remember my uid (not cid) so I don't have to OTP every time I execute a command!
# Add a /kill (or /exit) command incase I need to shutoff my robot!
# Read RSS feeds
# Ping Speed Test
# Automatic Bot Creator (Via Chat APIs)
# TODO: Register commands via dictionary and support wildcard commands
# Maybe eventually support timing of commands and modules to test for inefficiencies
