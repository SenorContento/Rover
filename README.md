#Minecraft
I am going to be working on the project https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft! I have a fork located at https://github.com/SenorContento/pyCraft! So, that means if you want to use the Minecraft module as this module will be set to work with my fork, then you need to copy the folder minecraft from the root of pyCraft to this project's root! Now, if you want to help with any of this project, you are more than welcome to!

Also, if you are worried about any licensing issues, I quoted the below text from https://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html!

"Apache 2 software can therefore be included in GPLv3 projects, because the GPLv3 license accepts our software into GPLv3 works. However, GPLv3 software cannot be included in Apache projects. The licenses are incompatible in one direction only, and it is a result of ASF's licensing philosophy and the GPLv3 authors' interpretation of copyright law."
